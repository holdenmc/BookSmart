If I'm alone,
I am nothing. 
To feel the sun,
To feel alive
Is the best.

And yells at the peas

He embarrasses the green beans

Learn to cultivate friendship and be united.
Honor the truth and be honest and lawful.

Little by little, carried by their curiosity, they associate, relate, interpret, understand, and describe the images, expressing the contents with their own words. At this age, the stories can serve in two ways: to train them and to develop in them the basic abilities of listening and of talking before beginning formal lessons and literature. 

For this reason, the stories that integrate this book are brief and simple and are carefully selected and adapted for children that are beginning to learn how to read. The attractive and interesting illustrations that appear in its pages serve to stimulate their oral expression. 

With this educational material, we propose to contribute to our children an education as good parents and in all moments, give thanks for nature and ask appreciation for the marvelous work of God. Let's look, at the same time, to give them situations in which they are helped to think about the fundamental virtues of their life, and above all, that they are pushed to put them to practical use. 

That, starting when they are young:
Learn to cultivate friendship and be united.
Honor the truth and be honest and lawful. 
Be accustomed to do the right things.
Appreciate the force and the work of the people around them. 
Respect each other and respect everyone else. 
Care for the children and have a special care and consideration for the sick and the old.
Don't resort to violence.
Take care of and honor Nature.
Cultivate and honor Peace.

Your repository must contain a docs/ directory. It must contain the following:

Flow diagram: You should outline the major components/stages of your project, and how they depend on eachother. 
Somewhere you must have an aggregation module and a quality control module. This should be more conceptual than technical. 
We are less concerned with your choice of Java classes and interfaces, but more with the big picutre. 
When does the crowd touch the data? What has to happen before that? What will happen after that? 
What is your criteria for determining that the crowd’s answers are “good enough” to move on? 
There are online tools for making flow diagrams that might be worth checking out.

Screen shots / mockups of some core interfaces that the crowd will see or that the end-users will see. 
This includes any HITs you plan to use in your project. There are lots of online mockup tools that you can consider using, 
although MS Paint is always a solid option as well.

README.md markdown file explaining the major components of your project. 
This should follow the schematic you created for your final project flow diagram. 
It should also indiciate what the high level milestones for each component are. 
To make sure you understand the complexity of your own project, 
each component should have a point value between (1-4) outlining the amount of work required to implement that section. 
A project suitable for this class should have between 15 - 20 points overall. 
In your Project update meeting the staff will help you redistribute point values.

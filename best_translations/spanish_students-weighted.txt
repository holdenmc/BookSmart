Gradually, they are driven by their curiosity, associate, relate, interpret, understand and describe images, expressing the contents with their own words. At this age, then, stories can serve a dual function: to entertain and go developing in them the basic skills of listening and speaking before starting the formal learning of reading and writing.
For this reason, the stories that make up this book are short and simple and are carefully selected and adapted for children beginning to learn to read. The attractive and interesting illustrations in its pages are intended to stimulate oral expression.
With this educational material, we intend to help our children to be educated as good Peruvians and that, at all times, love nature and can appreciate the wonderful open from God. We seek also to create situations that will help them think about fundamental values ​​for their life and, above all, to encourage them to implement them.

How beautiful is the world in which we live is more a compliment is not it; It is a mockery that I feel for riches and poverty.
With my strong and silent look, I will sing to the world as it is; if "God live what we live for, I assure you: It would not be like that!"

The duckling went for a walk. On the walk, the kitten greeted the duckling: "Meow, meow, meow!" The duckling wanted to say "meow" but couldn't. 

When the duckling was passing by, a dog approached it. The dog said to it: "Ruff!" The duckling wanted to say "ruff" but couldn't.

While the duckling was passing by, in a branch of a tree, a small bird sang. "Tweet-tweet-tweet!" The duckling wanted to say "tweet" but couldn't.

I believe that I dream and think that the tallest mountain will fall, that the tallest clouds will drop. 
Is it true what the rain says as it sings,  what it says the other night when the moon was voicing its regrets?

Do you want to see what I think?
It's only a dream.

Two old mice gave some wise advice to the little mouse.

While  an ant was searching for her food, a strong rain fell. So, she put herself in a hole in the trunk of a tree. Suddenly, a butterfly arrived and said to her: "I have wet wings and cannot fly." The ant answered, "Come, this place is very small, but here we can both stay." When the butterfly had settled, a mouse arrived running and said, " Please, the water has made me wet. I need a place." "Oh!" said the butterfly. The hollow is very small, but we will give you a small site. The rain continued to fall. Suddenly, a jumping bird arrived and said, "My feathers are wet and I cannot fly."

Because the special model

He always insults the poor turnip because it is white and has a tail. He says to the radish that it is bow-legged and short, and he yells at the peas: "Cone-shaped, needles, old"! At the humiliation of the carrot, the red tomato has invented bad rumors. He embarrasses the green beans for their greenness and skinniness. When he looks at the artichoke, he made it mope about its quills. And he laughed at the olluco, because it is fat and unrefined. He posited to the cabbage: "A thousand vests and only one sprout."

a happiness that we all want to have.

What is happiness?

something  that fizzles in the air,
it will, it  moves away from me...

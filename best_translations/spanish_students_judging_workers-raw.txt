-!Save the seal!
Yesterday, a hedgehog hurt her.
Yesterday the pig called.
-¿Do you have a nightingale?
Me and the nightingale could sing in your honor.
-!No way! !No!
!The pig will never sing with the nightingale!
Later, already darker, the kangaroo called:
-Tell me in my ear, ¿does the sheep still lives there?
I yelled indignant:
-!You're wrong!
!You got the wrong number!
!Call the central!

that moment;
it is almost impossible to conceive that someday
 there will be peace

Maybe when the day comes I will be in another world
so far where you will not see me;
but I will be happy,
My purpose will be fulfilled, that I will feel.

It is nearly impossible for this to happen,
but there is hope...
Always.

Mr. Red Tomato is a very naughty guy
He always insults the poor turnip because he is white and has a tail
He says curved and dwarf to the little radish and yells to the peas -!Little pills, dwarfs, old!
To the humble carrot, he has invented an ugly story. He shames the green beans because they are green and skinny.

that happiness that we all want to reach. 
And in fact: What is the happiness? 
It is perhaps a word, a gift, 
a flower a flower from elsewhere, of rare climates, 
of new times?

What is the happiness?
Something that comes out of nowhere,
it fades away in the air, 
it goes away, it moves away from me...
It gets lost.

¡Que susurro, que delicia!
Siento un fulgor de estrellas
invadiéndome
rodeándome.
¡Que sonido tan claro,
que lamento!
Y al pasar mis manos
por su cuerpo desnudo
siento que brinca
vibra
y pega un grito.

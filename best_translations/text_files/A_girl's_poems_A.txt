 that moment;
 it is almost impossible to conceive that someday
  there will be peace
 
 Maybe when the day comes I will be in another world
 so far where you will not see me;
 but I will be happy,
 My purpose will be fulfilled, that I will feel.
 
 It is nearly impossible for this to happen,
 but there is hope...
 Always.
 	mi guitarra
 ¡Que susurro, que delicia!
 Siento un fulgor de estrellas
 invadiéndome
 rodeándome.
 ¡Que sonido tan claro,
 que lamento!
 Y al pasar mis manos
 por su cuerpo desnudo
 siento que brinca
 vibra
 y pega un grito.
 	My bedroom
 There I go daily
 And I find always happy or sad .
 It is cozy and very small
 but it gives me a peaceful environment
 and consolation .
 My bed , my guitar next ,
 my desk,
 where he spent long hours writing .
 My corner , my altar my palace ,
 the field of all battles
 a lover seeking to be hunted
 and the ballroom at a party.
 	
 	
 	Poetic Dance
 
 i'd want to be a poet;
 that flowers rhyme to the sound of my poetry,
 that rain when falling become harmony,
 that my voice coming out, becomes a song

 	Mother got that crazy idea!
 I wanted to be a poet and not a child
 but not bad, but good.
 I do not think it's so easy!
 
 I guess my name
 on a white paste,
 libraries full of people buying.
 My enchanted family,
 my cheerful heart,
 and my mind creating
 more and more thoughts.
 	
 	a dream
 a well high night with a good clean sky.
 birds singing melodies without rhythm.
 the wind feels when he says a lament
 a old whitebeard when he say "i love you"
 a quiet girl thinks and compound a dream.
 leaf of the trees says a think
 she is silent and reason she like to catch a dream.
 a dream that escapes because he wants own
 and she`s mother call her she wants to give advice
 	
 	
 	a un muchacho
 esos ojos que cambian de color 
 y esa risa, rara vez natural,
 muchas veces fingida.
 ¡si supieras cuanto me haces pensar!
 	
 	I have to stay strong, without turning the face. Always going on, walk and fight. Getting to the goal, crown myself with flowers.  And then always continue without returning behind.
 	A Girl's Poems
 	My soul, my mother and the heavens
 
 When I look the flowers and compare myself to them
 I see how I sink from so beauty.
 
 When I look the heavens and see them so clean, I
 see my soul dirty before such purity
 
 when I see my mother and see her so tender, I have 
 desire of speak to her and say that I love her.
 	
 	poems of a girl
 of Milagros Terán
 Marta Toledo illustrations
 	live
 if I'm alone
 I'm nothing.
 feel the sun
 feel alive
 It is the best.
 
 hear a bird sing,
 see a flower born,
 feel when the sun burns ...
 That's really live!
 
 I want to convey this message to young
 because I am like them.
 when you feel the rain fall
 You will live.
 	every time I see the sea love you more and more 
 my heart throbs when I dedicate a smile , a smile that expresses everything I could not explain in words not if you know it , but I love secret, my love is bigger than the sea, and my most sincere and clear that a wave feelings burst
 	I beginning to open their eyes and also I begin to see.
 I 've changed , I 'm sorry .
 I am like them, Those of the world .
 Why they are so?
 And yet, I  love them, though they may not realize it.
 I do not want to be like them, because they are bad .
 They have to be so, to continue living .
 They have made ​​me so, as I am.
 I understand them, but ...
 and too Me? ...
 Who Understands me?
 	RECLAMO
 Qué lindo mundo en el que vivimos, 
 será un halago más no es así;
 es una burla la que yo siento
 por las riquezas y la pobreza.
 
 Con mi mirada recia y callada,
 cantaré al mundo tal como es;
 si Dios viviera lo que vivimos,
 yo te aseguro:¡No sería asi!
 	my soul
 
 feel my soul is rising 
 and lost in the clouds
 ¿where it going?
 cross mountains and rivers
 volcanos and lakes
 and always follow there:
 going up
 going up
 is a modern soul
 at last
 stop it, look at me
 and follow tour way
 is a soul without course
 	I dream that some day I will reach the happiness, 
 that happiness that we all want to reach. 
 And in fact: What is the happiness? 
 It is perhaps a word, a gift, 
 a flower a flower from elsewhere, of rare climates, 
 of new times?
 
 What is the happiness?
 Something that comes out of nowhere,
 it fades away in the air, 
 it goes away, it moves away from me...
 It gets lost.
 	my braces 
 I have spent many months
 led these chains, in my teeth ...
  to be more beautiful, 
 to close the mouth to smile as princess.
 hey released me!
  Gone with the wires
  barbed, handcuffs, 
 chains crossed
 	inside my mouth happy as fish swim my teeth.
 They are smooth as rose petals
 They are smooth as silk, they are free to eat jocote
 mop handle
 hard corn cobs.
 	Today I feel sad , why I do not know ; I would like to go beyond where you can go to be alone.
 laugh , sing and enjoy freely.
 I wanted to go to a place where there is only love and peace that is what this world needs to be truly happy .
 
 I would, but I can not help this world more . So I am little thing would be useless .
 
 But if instead. all were proposed to help, cooperate with me . if there would be peace , tranquility
 	case maybe,
 
 
 if maybe you wanted keep stealing lel sky,
 not talk
 
 maybe someday if you keep silent,
 I would steal my life without feeling.
 
 if maybe you wanted to keep talking about my life.
 you qerria
 
 if maybe from high in the sky you feel like a bird,
 Cantarias.
 
 feel the glory of life in death
 and deep Cantarias patent idea.
 	The bamboo 
 The Bamboo bending with 
 the Sleepy edge of the night.
  Errguidos and firm dance to the compas of a strange music.
  their strong stems sing a dance
  while the cold lanoche tells them that tonteria.
  That noise... !That Strange¡
  Seems that shatter 
 the bamboo more high.
  And later amanace. 
 The birds alight at their summits.
  They still, already tired are already rest,
  and birds they 
 participated in the night.
 	Mi Vida
 La vida es mi vida mi mundo.
 Mi vivir, mi soñar, mi nace.
 El sentir que vivo para todos. 
 El sentir que no vivo por vivir
 	
 	añoranza
 ¿es que no lo comprendes o no quieres?
 ¿no sabes que te añoro, que en mi corazon las lagrimas me ahogan?
 ¿que soñando con tigo todo el dia espero?
 ¿es que no lo comprendes?
 	These poems were written in 1975 by Milagros Teran .

 	Prayer
 
 give me what I no have
 I'm asking you.
 I want what is missing.
 Full me of all of the world
 (the good of the people, no the bad)
 
 with anxiety take of the morning
 and live my full life
 no empty
 I beg you
 	I think I dream the highest mountain will fall, whick I will take the highest clouds. Its true what they say rain on your singing, what you said the other night when the moon told me her grief?
 I'm new, I replied
 I don't understand you nor I understand your singing.
 Do you wanna hear what I think?
 It is just a dream.
 	
 	Walking along the path of life, we come singing. like three butterflies that go together, like three hearts that love each other, dreaming, singing, enjoying life, rebozantes of joy in our lives.
 Mr. watched us from heaven sharing with us the greatness, the greatness of living and be united.
 laughing, wanting, we came praying, asking the Lord in heaven.
 	poems girls
 	
 	in the nature
 	My shoes
 my colege's shoes
 it's a moccasins of black leather
 Don't have heel.
 Cath whit his sole the sun rays of the sidewalk
 My colege's shoes
 They were before of laces
 of two colors
 they have an slot where we put
 a coin.
 I don't have tie yet.
 They free in the streets like pigeons
 	I give all my soul, my help is not much.
 I give them all my smile. 
 
 I feel a big tree without roots because I'm a walker on the path of life.
 I am that still have to learn a lot and to appreciate what is in this life.
 	To a friend
 
 I need you.
 I need your help and ask for it.
 I do not leave me I need to heat your brindas me .
 No one understands the affection I feel , I do not know .
 
 It is something special that is within me and burn me .
 It is a love sister.
 And I ask you to never leave me .

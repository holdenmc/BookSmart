 	Dear tadpoles, this book aims to show that we are not as ugly as toads, or maybe if we are ugly. But we can sometimes resemble humans, and it is not that humans are ugly, or maybe you.
 First of all, it is important that some differences between frogs and toads are cleared.
 
 Toads are very fat and sometimes lazy have short legs and body covered with wart,s unlike frogs, we prefer to walk rather than jump.
 	This frog is so crazy that always claims to be an enchanted prince
 	Wow if an artist!

 It is also prankster
 and very vain.

 Everything causes horror!

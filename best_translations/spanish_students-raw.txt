Gradually, they are driven by their curiosity, associate, relate, interpret, understand and describe images, expressing the contents with their own words. At this age, then, stories can serve a dual function: to entertain and go developing in them the basic skills of listening and speaking before starting the formal learning of reading and writing.
For this reason, the stories that make up this book are short and simple and are carefully selected and adapted for children beginning to learn to read. The attractive and interesting illustrations in its pages are intended to stimulate oral expression.
With this educational material, we intend to help our children to be educated as good Peruvians and that, at all times, love nature and can appreciate the wonderful open from God. We seek also to create situations that will help them think about fundamental values ​​for their life and, above all, to encourage them to implement them.

If I'm alone,
I am nothing. 
To feel the sun,
To feel alive
Is the best.

To hear a bird sing,
To see a flower born, 
To feel the sun burn...
That is really what it is like to live!

I want to transmit this message to the youth
because I am like them: 
When they feel the rain fall
that is living.

As we walk down life's  path, 
let us  sing.
how three little butterflies play together,
how three little hearts who desire,
playing, singing, and enjoying the life,
brimming with joy in our souls.

God who watches us from heaven
compares his greatness with us

Laughing, wanting, we have been praying
asking for God that is in heaven

How beautiful is the world in which we live is more a compliment is not it; It is a mockery that I feel for riches and poverty.
With my strong and silent look, I will sing to the world as it is; if "God live what we live for, I assure you: It would not be like that!"

While  an ant was searching for her food, a strong rain fell. So, she put herself in a hole in the trunk of a tree. Suddenly, a butterfly arrived and said to her: "I have wet wings and cannot fly." The ant answered, "Come, this place is very small, but here we can both stay." When the butterfly had settled, a mouse arrived running and said, " Please, the water has made me wet. I need a place." "Oh!" said the butterfly. The hollow is very small, but we will give you a small site. The rain continued to fall. Suddenly, a jumping bird arrived and said, "My feathers are wet and I cannot fly."

They are smooth like rose petals. They are smooth like thirst. They are free to eat jocote, mango mechudo, hard cobs of corn.

In a house like this, close to the Amazon river, lives Juanita with her dad, her mom, and Pedrito.

Pedrito likes to play near the river, Juanita tells him: "Pedrito, Lets Play", but the boy is mischevious and leaves all alone. Since Pedrito runs the risk of drowning, his sister takes care of him and takes him home.

Yesterday, he called the pig: "Do you have a Mockingbird? The nightingale and I could sing a song in his honor." "No way! No sir! It will never sing the nightingale with the pig!"

Later, when it was dark, he called the kangaroo: "Tell me, does the sheep live there?" It shouted indignantly: "You are wrong! He has scored wrong! Call the center!"

I give all my support,
my help is not much.
I give them all
my smile

I feel like a big tree
rootless
because I'm a walker
on the road of life

I know I have to learn a lot
still
and to appreciate
what is in this life

To where will it go? It crosses the mountains and rivers, volcanoes, and lakes, and always continues like this: rising, rising. It is a modern soul. Finally, it pauses, it looks at me and continues its walk. It is a soul without course.

Dr. Ouch, calms  all pain.
He answers every call to the alarm -
They have become sick? 
Oh, what a coincidence!

The doctor hurries out
with a striped briefcase
full of medications.

The most desperate say:
Help me! Where are you?
See, that I cannot anymore.

Maria wrapped him in diapers and leaned him back in a manger. An angel was presented to some shepherds who were taking care of their sheep and announced to them the birth of the boy Jesus. The shepherds hurried up and knelt to worship the boy Jesus. Immediately, thousands of angels appeared to praise the God singing: Glory to god in the heights and peace on earth to the men who love the Lord. A mysterious star guided the Three Wise Men during a long journey until they arrived in Bethlehem. The Three Wise Men worshipped the boy Jesus, and offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

Perhaps that day that I in the other world, beyond where will not see me; but if you'll be happy to feel that my purpose is over.  It is almost impossible to happen, but...there is always hope.

When I am alone
I tell my pains to the air
So that it can notice my suffering

When the hours pass
and my cries have stopped
I feel that my living has ended

That I am like a rose
that I was marching
that i do not have color
nor do I interest anyone

He always insults the poor turnip because it is white and has a tail. He says to the radish that it is bow-legged and short, and he yells at the peas: "Cone-shaped, needles, old"! At the humiliation of the carrot, the red tomato has invented bad rumors. He embarrasses the green beans for their greenness and skinniness. When he looks at the artichoke, he made it mope about its quills. And he laughed at the olluco, because it is fat and unrefined. He posited to the cabbage: "A thousand vests and only one sprout."

Those eyes that change color
And that smile, rarely natural
often unfeigned
If you knew how you make me think!

Everytime I see the sea
I love you more and more

When my heart palpitates
I give you a smile
A smile that shows what I couldnt
explain with words

I dont know if you know
But I secretly love you
My love is bigger than the sea
And my feelings clearer
and more sincere
Than a wave as it strikes

The stork put on the table a bottle of comminuted food. He put his beak into it and ate until all of it was finished. The fox remained uselessly licking the neck of the bottle. Upon finishing, the stork said, "I hope, friend, that you have been satisfied." The fox did not respond to him. Very upset, he returned to his house with his tail between his legs. The fox never imagined that the stork would be more sly than him.

He stops. Looks at it. He approaches; touches. And discovered a piece of cheese ! Sniffs . Tempts . He gobbles the cheese and falls into the trap! 

I'll tell you another story of three mice sleeping happily in the three drawers. They find their food , they wash their clothes , they sing , they're lulled to sleep.

I  dream that one day I  will find a  happiness,
a happiness that we all want to have.
And then I realized:  What is happiness?
Is it perhaps a question, a rule,  
a flower from another place, a rare climate,
from another time?

What is happiness?
Something that comes out of nowhere,
something  that fizzles in the air,
it will, it  moves away from me...
It is lost.

I grabbed it by the tail and I didn't get the worm out. 
"Pull!" I told my brother - It looks like it is a giant worm. 
But suddenly - What a surprise! - it was actually a rat.

The duckling was sad. It couldn't say "meow", it couldn't say "ruff", it couldn't say "tweet", it couldn't say "moo"! 

The mother duck tried to calm the duckling, saying: "Quack, quack, quack, quack!" The duckling finally responded: "Quack, quack, quack!" The duckling then understood that he could say "Quack, quack, quack"!

What a whisper, how delicious!
I feel a glow from the stars
Invading me
Enveloping me

What a clear sound, what regret.
Passing my hands over her naked body
I feel that she bounces
vibrates
and yells.
